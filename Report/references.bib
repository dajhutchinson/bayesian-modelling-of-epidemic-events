	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques are a suite of model fitting methods which can be implemented without a using likelihood function. In order to use ABC in a time-efficient manner users must make several design decisions including how to code the ABC algorithm and the type of ABC algorithm to use. Furthermore, ABC relies on a number of user defined choices which can greatly effect the accuracy of estimation. Having a clear understanding of these factors in reducing computation time and improving accuracy allows users to make more informed decisions when planning analyses. In this paper, we present an introduction to ABC with a focus of application to infectious disease models. We present a tutorial on coding practice for ABC in R and three case studies to illustrate the application of ABC to infectious disease models.}

  abstract={The analysis of high-dimensional data sets is often forced to rely upon well-chosen summary statistics. A systematic approach to choosing such statistics, which is based upon a sound theoretical framework, is currently lacking. In this paper we develop a sequential scheme for scoring statistics according to whether their inclusion in the analysis will substantially improve the quality of inference. Our method can be applied to high-dimensional data sets for which exact likelihood equations are not possible. We illustrate the potential of our approach with a series of examples drawn from genetics. In summary, in a context in which well-chosen summary statistics are of high importance, we attempt to put the `well' into `chosen.'},

However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics. A number of open problems are highlighted in the discussion.},
