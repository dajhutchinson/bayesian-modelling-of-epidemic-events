	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques are a suite of model fitting methods which can be implemented without a using likelihood function. In order to use ABC in a time-efficient manner users must make several design decisions including how to code the ABC algorithm and the type of ABC algorithm to use. Furthermore, ABC relies on a number of user defined choices which can greatly effect the accuracy of estimation. Having a clear understanding of these factors in reducing computation time and improving accuracy allows users to make more informed decisions when planning analyses. In this paper, we present an introduction to ABC with a focus of application to infectious disease models. We present a tutorial on coding practice for ABC in R and three case studies to illustrate the application of ABC to infectious disease models.}

  abstract={The analysis of high-dimensional data sets is often forced to rely upon well-chosen summary statistics. A systematic approach to choosing such statistics, which is based upon a sound theoretical framework, is currently lacking. In this paper we develop a sequential scheme for scoring statistics according to whether their inclusion in the analysis will substantially improve the quality of inference. Our method can be applied to high-dimensional data sets for which exact likelihood equations are not possible. We illustrate the potential of our approach with a series of examples drawn from genetics. In summary, in a context in which well-chosen summary statistics are of high importance, we attempt to put the `well' into `chosen.'},

    abstract = "{Due to an almost complete absence of fossil record, the evolutionary history of chimpanzees has only been studied recently on the basis of genetic data. Although the general topology of the chimpanzee phylogeny is well established, uncertainties remain concerning the size of current and past populations, the occurrence of bottlenecks or population expansions, or about divergence times and migrations rates between subspecies. Here, we present a novel attempt at globally inferring the detailed evolution of the Pan genus based on approximate Bayesian computation, an approach preferentially applied to complex models where the likelihood cannot be computed analytically. Based on two microsatellite and DNA sequence data sets and adjusting simulated data for local levels of inbreeding and patterns of missing data, we find support for several new features of chimpanzee evolution as compared with previous studies based on smaller data sets and simpler evolutionary models. We find that the central chimpanzees are certainly the oldest population of all P. troglodytes subspecies and that the other two P. t. subspecies diverged from the central chimpanzees by founder events. We also find an older divergence time (1.6 million years [My]) between common chimpanzee and Bonobos than previous studies (0.9–1.3 My), but this divergence appears to have been very progressive with the maintenance of relatively high levels of gene flow between the ancestral chimpanzee population and the Bonobos. Finally, we could also confirm the existence of strong unidirectional gene flow from the western into the central chimpanzee. These results show that interesting and innovative features of chimpanzee history emerge when considering their whole evolutionary history in a single analysis, rather than relying on simpler models involving several comparisons of pairs of populations.}",

	abstract = {In this paper a beginning is made on the sampling theory of neutral alleles. That is, we consider deductive and subsequently inductive questions relating to a sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus. The inductions concern estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. In particular the test of the hypothesis that the alleles being sampled are indeed selectively neutral will be considered. In view of the large amount of data currently being obtained by electrophoretic methods on allele frequencies and numbers, and the current interest in the possibility of extensive “non-Darwinian” evolution, such a sampling theory seems necessary. However, a large number of unsolved problems in this area remain, a partial listing being given towards the end of this paper.}

The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

@book{sufficient_statistics,
  abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
		  principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
		  of probability, the authors develop the theory of
		  statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
		  concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
		  and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
		  first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid
		  mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
		  being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
		  concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
		  a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
		  optimality investigations.}},

 abstract = {All known theorems of the Darmois-Koopman-Pitman type are based on the assumption of absolutely continuous probabilities. In this article, a Darmois-Koopman-Pitman type theorem is proved for families of probability measures that are defined on discrete sample spaces. Two assumptions are imposed on the sufficient statistic for the family: (1) the range space of the sufficient statistic can be completely ordered, and (2) this ordering of the range space of the sufficient statistic has a certain regularity property. Under (1) and (2), it can be proved that the given family is exponential of order 1.},
